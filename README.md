# Web_Visualization_Challenge

This project ushered for the creation of a dynamic HTML webpage in uninison with Plotly and d3 to analyze a belly button diveristy data-set. 

First, the initial plots with initial chosen parameters were displayed in order to be changed by dynamic scripting in JS. 

Drop down menus were then included on the webpage, and upon a value change each graph( a bar graph and a bubble chart) would change based on the selected value.

The values in the drop down menus were dynamically created using d3 and the output was filtered for using the chosen value.
